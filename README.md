# Risk-and-return-prediction-with-LLM
In this paper I present an evidence, that miss-pricing of Fama-French Five factor
model could be explained with investors’ sentiment. I use LLM prompt based methodology
developed by Slonimczyk (2024) to extract sentiment scores from 10-K and 10-Q reports of
US companies from S&P 500 list for 2018 to 2024. Using double Fixed-Effects model I have
shown that LLM sentiment scores are superior to old-fashioned ”bag-of-words” approach.
I assess the distribution of sentiment across different types of reports. I found no evidence
that only a specific part of 10-K or 10-Q report contain superior sentiment information.
I disentangle predictive ability of my sentiment scores by decomposing different types
of risk premia from returns. Statistical evidence suggests, that my sentiment scores are
orthogonal to Fama-French factors, hence, they might serve as a material for constructing
a sentiment factor.
