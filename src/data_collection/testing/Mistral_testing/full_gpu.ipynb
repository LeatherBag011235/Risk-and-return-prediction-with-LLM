    "Financial Performance\n",
    "For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, revenue declined 8.7% year-over-year to $640 million, primarily due to reduced order volumes and pricing pressures in the steel manufacturing segment. Gross profit decreased 11.2% to $172 million, with gross margin contracting to 26.9%, down from 29.3% in Q1 2023, reflecting higher raw material costs.\n",

Net income attributable to shareholders was $41 million, representing a 29.4% year-over-year decrease, leading to diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88, compared to $1.23 in Q1 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational Challenges and Cost Management\n",
    "CoreSteel experienced weaker demand in North America and Europe, where key customers delayed capital investments amid economic uncertainty. Additionally, higher energy and labor costs pressured margins. The company initiated a cost-reduction program targeting $50 million in annualized savings, including workforce optimization and supply chain restructuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital expenditures in Q1 were $52 million, primarily allocated to equipment upgrades and digitalization initiatives. CoreSteel ended the quarter with $284 million in cash and equivalents, maintaining financial flexibility, although net debt increased to $1.18 billion, raising leverage concerns.\n",

The company remains focused on cost containment, operational efficiency, and supply chain resilience while assessing opportunities for strategic realignment.\n",
